      <h2> This website provides information on the best coffee shops and work
          spaces in London. Each venue has been personally vetted by our team at
          Coffi. We have designed this site with students in mind, and therefore
          have chosen a variety of venues to match different needs. We understand
          that student working hours do not conform the the usual 9-5 opening
          times of cafes, so therefore we have found study venues with better
          opening hours for students to take advantage of. </h2>

        Hi, I am Izzy! Having lived in London almost all my life I have had
        plenty of time to seek out the best working venues in London. Having
        just graduated myself, I understand the daily stresses that university
        and exam term can bring to students, therefore I hope this website
        can play a role in reducing this stress. </p>
