        <h2> This website provides information on the best coffee shops and work
            spaces in London. Each venue has been personally vetted by our team at
            Coffi. We have designed this site with students in mind, and therefore
            have chosen a variety of venues to match different needs. We understand
            that student working hours do not conform the the usual 9-5 opening
            times of cafes, so therefore we have found study venues with better
            opening hours for students to take advantage of. </h2>

                Hi, I am Izzy! Having lived in London almost all my life I have had
                plenty of time to seek out the best working venues in London. Having
                just graduated myself, I understand the daily stresses that university
                and exam term can bring to students, therefore I hope this website
                can play a role in reducing this stress.

                Hi, I am Gioia! I moved to London for uni a few years ago, and being
                used to 'coffee culture' from home (Zurich, Switzerland) I intended
                to continue my leisurely lifestyle here. I was surprised to find that
                cafes either closed quite early, or that whipping out your laptop
                provoked disapproving looks. I hope this website will provide
                some insight into where you can work free and easy until late at night
                or even early in the morning.
