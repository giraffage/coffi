    <h2> This website provides information on the best coffee shops and work
      spaces in London. Each venue has been personally vetted by our team at
      Coffi. We have designed this site with students in mind, and therefore
      have chosen a variety of venues to match different needs. We understand
      that student working hours do not conform the the usual 9-5 opening
      times of cafes, so therefore we have found study venues with better
      opening hours for students to take advantage of. </h2>

        Hi, I am Izzy! Having lived in London almost all my life I have had
        plenty of time to seek out the best working venues in London. Having
        just graduated myself, I understand the daily stresses that university
        and exam term can bring to students, therefore I hope this website
        can play a role in reducing this stress. </p>

          Hi, I am Gioia! I moved to London for uni a few years ago, and being
          used to 'coffee culture' from home (Zurich, Switzerland) I intended
          to continue my leisurely lifestyle here. I was surprised to find that
          cafes either closed quite early, or that whipping out your laptop
          provoked disapproving looks. I hope this website will provide
          some insight into where you can work free and easy until late at night
          or even early in the morning. </p>
